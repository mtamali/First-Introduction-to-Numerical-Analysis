title: Introduction
description: 'Applied mathematics and scientific computing play an increasing role in the design of industrial products; however, it is only one link in a long chain that mobilizes numerous and varied intellectual resources to arrive at designing, at best and in a timely manner, the desired product. The level of complexity of the systems is very high at a level where any social integration of the resulting products would be without damage or side effects. In contrast, the majority of technological products are just the immediate solution to many of the problems of everyday life. The advent of products, consumer goods, such as computers, the Internet and telecommunications, to each its tools, has revolutionized the working methodologies of teams and research laboratories. Software tools and suites are a great help to process modeling and simulation work. The computer and the means of design are the vectors which caused a clear improvement in the speed of implementation of exploitable means. Computer-aided design (CAD) software has played a major role in the development of many processes (Modeling) and has facilitated the understanding of many phenomena (Simulation).'
